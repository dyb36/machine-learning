# Iris-Hierarchial-Clustering
Clustering Iris Dataset using Hierarchial Clustering.
In this notebook, sklearn was used to conduct hierarchical clustering on the Iris dataset which contains 4 dimensions/attributes and 150 samples. Each sample is labeled as one of the three type of Iris flowers.
The labelling and cluster based on attributes are ignored and various forms of linking are used and is followed by visualizations.
